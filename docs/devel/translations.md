# Translations

The document describes the proper way to introduce new translations to the project.

## Overview

All translation data is stored in `i18n` directory in project's root. It includes configuration file
(`locale_conf.json`) and translation files for each language (`messages-en.xtb`, `messages-ja.xtb` and other).

## Providing translations for a new language

To provide translations for a new language following steps have to be followed.

#### Update configuration file

Update `locale_conf.json` file to add new entry. Assuming following configuration:

```json
{
  "translations": [
    {"file": "messages-en.xtb", "key": "en"},
    {"file": "messages-zh.xtb", "key": "zh"},
    {"file": "messages-ja.xtb", "key": "ja"}
  ]
}
```

Following entry should be added:


```json
{"file": "messages-es.xtb", "key": "es"}
```

So configuration should look like this:

```json
{
  "translations": [
    {"file": "messages-en.xtb", "key": "en"},
    {"file": "messages-zh.xtb", "key": "zh"},
    {"file": "messages-ja.xtb", "key": "ja"},
    {"file": "messages-es.xtb", "key": "es"}
  ]
}
```

#### Generate translation file

To generate translation file run:

```sh
gulp generate-xtbs
```

As a result new translation file should appear in `i18n` directory.

## Providing translations

To provide translations for specific language you should open one of the translation files and replace its English
content in `<translation>` markup elements. Assuming file is being translated to Spanish following element in
translation file:

```xml
<translation id="0" key="MSG_WELCOME" desc="Welcome message.">Welcome</translation>
```

Should be updated to:

```xml
<translation id="0" key="MSG_WELCOME" desc="Welcome message.">Bienvenido</translation>
```
