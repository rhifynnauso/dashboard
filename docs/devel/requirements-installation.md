# Installing Requirements for the Kubernetes Dashboard

This document assumes you have a Linux machine (or VM), and that you have a brand new Ubuntu Linux environment setup, but does not assume familiarity with Linux. If you don't have a Linux environment and you're using Windows, you may want to read instructions on how to setup a Linux VM on Windows first.

Before you begin please make sure you can connect to your Linux machine and login. Command line instructions for Linux will be shown starting with `$`; you should only type the text following the `$`.

## Basic Setup
Based on instructions from: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/

This will update Linux and get curl and vim, which you'll need later.
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install curl
$ sudo apt-get install vim
```
Unless you have another text editor you prefer, vim may be useful for beginners; instructions below use vim.

### Initial checks
```
$ uname -r
```
You should get `3.2.0-23-generic`, `3.13.0-88-generic`, or something similar depending on what the current version is.

```
$ lsb_release -a
```
^ You should get a response like:
```
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS
Release:        12.04
Codename:       precise
```

## Get Kubernetes

```
$ curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.2.4/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
```
*This will take a while.*

## Get Vagrant on Linux

```
$ sudo apt-get install vagrant
$ cd kubernetes
$ export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=vagrant
$ ./cluster/kube-up.sh
```
*Note that the last command will throw a lot of errors.*


## Install Git
```
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git --version
```
These instructions were last tested with git version 1.7.9.5.


## Clone the Dashboard Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard.git
```

## Install Kubernetes Dashboard Requirements

See the requirement list on the [Getting Started page](getting-started.md).

### Install Docker

Based on instructions from: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/

#### Setup
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
```

```
$ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
$ sudo vim docker.list
```
* <kbd>i</kbd> = insert
* Type `deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-precise main`
* <kbd>Esc</kbd> = stops inserting
* `:x` = exits and saves

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get purge lxc-docker
$ apt-cache policy docker-engine
```

#### Only needed for Ubuntu Precise 12.04
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-trusty
$ sudo reboot
```
#### Do the Docker install
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install docker-engine
$ sudo service docker start
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

You should receive a message that includes: `This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly`.

#### Configure Docker for your user
Based on instructions from https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/#create-a-docker-group

The example below uses "username" as a placeholder. Please substitute with the user you are logged in as, which can be seen by using `$ id`.
If you are running Linux in a VM using Vagrant, your username will be "vagrant".

```
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker username
$ env
$ sudo reboot
$ docker run hello-world
```

You should get the same message as above, that includes: `This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly`.

`$ status docker` --> should say  "docker start/running, process [some number]"
`$ docker ps` --> should show a table of information (or at least headers)


### Install Go

Get the latest download URL from https://golang.org/dl/
```
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.6.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
*Add Go to the path*
```
$ go version
```
Should return something like `go version go1.6.2 linux/amd64`. Note that if you already had Go installed, ensure that `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` is unset.

### Install Node and NPM
For some reason doing this...
```
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
... gives a much older version, so instead we will get the more recent version:
```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```
Should return `v6.2.1` and `3.9.3` respectively.

### Install Java 7
```
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre
$ java -version
```
Should return `java version "1.7.0_101"`.

### Install Gulp using npm 
```
$ sudo npm install --global gulp-cli
$ sudo npm install --global gulp
$ gulp -v
```
Should return `CLI version 3.9.1` and `Local version 3.9.1`.

## Install Other Dashboard Dependencies Automatically with NPM

```
$ cd /dashboard
$ npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies that are in the `package.json` file.

## Run the Kubernetes Cluster
```
$ gulp local-up-cluster
```
If you need to stop the cluster you can run `$ docker kill $(docker ps -aq)`

```
$ gulp serve
```
