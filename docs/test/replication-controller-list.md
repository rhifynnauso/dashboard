# Replication controller list

## Prerequisites
Cluster with few deployed applications, where: 

* at least one is valid
* at least one is invalid (for example with wrong image) 

## Expected result
Page displays correctly, especially:

* cards are displayed correctly even when page is scaled down/up
* application details are valid and matching data from `kubectl` command
* logs menu display correct pods information
* all application actions are available
* invalid applications have warning symbols and error messages
