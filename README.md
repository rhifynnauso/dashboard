# Kubernetes Console
Kubernetes Console is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows to manage applications running in the cluster, troubleshoot them, as well as, manage the cluster itself.

The console is currently under active development and is not ready for production use (yet!).
