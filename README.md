Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to
manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster
itself.

## Usage

The Dashboard is currently under active development and is not ready for production use (yet!). To run the latest _unstable_ version execute the following command:

`kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/src/deploy/kubernetes-dashboard-canary.yaml`

## Documentation

* The [Design overview](docs/design/README.md) describes design concepts of Dashboard

* The [Developer guide](docs/devel/README.md) is for anyone wanting to contribute to Dashboard
