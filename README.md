# Kubernetes Dashboard
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kubernetes/dashboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kubernetes/dashboard)

Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows to
manage applications running in the cluster, troubleshoot them, as well as, manage the cluster
itself.

The dashboard is currently under active development and is not ready for production use (yet!).
