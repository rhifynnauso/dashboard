Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to
manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster
itself.

## Usage

It is likely that Dashboard is already installed on your cluster. To access it navigate in your
browser to one of the following URLs: `https://<kubernetes-master>/ui` which redirects to
`https://<kubernetes-master>/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard`.

If you find that youâ€™re not able to access the Dashboard you can install and open the latest
stable release by running the following commands:
```bash
kubectl create -f https://rawgit.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/src/deploy/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
kubectl proxy --port=8080
```
And then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard`
