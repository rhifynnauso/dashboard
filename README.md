Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to
manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster
itself.

## Usage
It is likely that the Dashboard is already installed on your cluster. To access it navigate in your
browser to the following URL: `https://<kubernetes-master>/ui`.

If you find that youâ€™re not able to access the Dashboard, you can install and open the latest
stable release by running the following commands:
```bash
kubectl create -f https://rawgit.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/src/deploy/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
```
And then navigate to `https://<kubernetes-master>/ui`

If it asks for a password, use `$ kubectl config view` to find it.

## Alternative Usage
Alternatively, you may access the UI via the Service Proxy. This is useful if you have a `kubectl`
configured with access to the cluster, but lack password credentials for use in a browser:

```bash
kubectl proxy
```

This will make the dashboard available at [http://localhost:8001/ui](http://localhost:8001/ui)

This will only be available from the machine where the command is executed, but you can see
`kubectl proxy --help` for more options.
